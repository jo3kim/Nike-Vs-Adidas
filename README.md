### Background
This project has a self reporting analyzation based on data downloaded on the highest rating and reviewed Adidas and Nike shoe.

The data does not include where the population came from, but the sample reviewed and rated the shoes from a 1 to 5 scale (no description of how the rating was concluded is included. As a business standpoint, this allows each company to see which shoe was the most and least liked in 2020.
