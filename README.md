### Background
This project has a self reporting analyzation based on data downloaded on the highest rating and reviewed Adidas and Nike shoe. Through Kaggle: the data was downloaded describing 2020 results of all of the shoe models released. The data does not include where the population came from, but the sample reviewed and rated the shoes from a 1 to 5 scale (no description of how the rating was concluded is included. As a business standpoint, this allows each company to see which shoe was the most and least liked in 2020. This is also interesting to the fact that 2020 was the first year of the pandemic, and also a time where people had more availability to shop (due to shutdowns). As a shoe business, it is important to keep track on what shoes are the most and least liked to keep track of continual model releases and collaborations.

### Business Question
With the background kept in mind, a business question was obtained: 
What are the most and least favorited shoe of 2020 from Nike and Adidas?

3. Duplicates

5. Spelling/Grammer
